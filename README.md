# cliDan
An AI-based Bash CLI helper.

## IMPORTANT
This is a crazy little AI app and is intended for use ONLY by adventurous experts. In it's current form, cliDan automatically executes CLI commands that are written by a large language model. Bad things can happen!

## DOCUMENTATION
Since this app is not intended for beginners (see 'IMPORTANT'), I will not provide more than minimal documentation. I refuse to help anyone shoot themselves in the foot.

## INSTALL
  - Create a `.env` file with:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=\<YOUR KEY>
      - OPENAI_API_ORG=\<YOUR ORG ID>
  - `yarn install`

## Usage
  ```
  cliDan.sh list files by date, most recent last
